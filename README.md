## Getting Started with the CLI

You can use [Crystallize CLI][17] to bootstrap a project with this
`Nuxt.js + Vue` boilerplate.

Simply run the following command (>= Node 8 required):

```sh
npx @crystallize/cli my-project
```

This will walk you through the steps of specifying your tenant, choosing the
template (Nuxt.js + Vue) and adding additional features such as Vercel.

Once your project has been created, you can simply navigate into your project's
directory and run the following to start up your development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will start up the server on http://localhost:3000 for development.
