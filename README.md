# Crystallize Boilerplates

Here are managed all the Crystallize Boilerplates.

In order to simplify their maintenance they are all in this Git Repository.

All contributions will happen here:
- PRs and Issues are therefore open, discuss, contribute in one place
- Many things will be shared accross the `components`: Coding Standards, CI & Automations, Tests, etc.

âœ… Nevertheless, all the `compoenents` (here boilerplates) will continue to be independant and pushed in their own repository. (through magic mechanisms that we have internally)
